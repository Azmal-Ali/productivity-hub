# Features

âœ¨ YouTube Video Analysis

ðŸ”¹The app uses AI + YouTube data to analyze comments, likes, and engagement to check if a video is reliable or misleading. Fake/duplicate comments are filtered out with spam detection models, and multilingual sentiment analysis ensures insights across different languages.

âœ¨ Video Summaries & Comparison

ðŸ”¹Summaries: AI automatically generates a short summary of a video, so users donâ€™t waste time watching irrelevant or misleading content.

ðŸ”¹Comparison: Users can compare two videos side-by-side on parameters like content clarity, correctness, bias, and engagement to find the best one for their needs.

âœ¨ Curated Free Courses

ðŸ”¹The app brings together handpicked free courses from trusted EdTech platforms. Courses that offer certificates are highlighted first to help users build credibility in their learning journey. This saves learners time from searching across multiple platforms.

âœ¨ AI Tool Recommender

ðŸ”¹With new AI tools launching daily, itâ€™s hard to keep track. The app recommends free, useful AI tools based on what the user is learning or working on. This ensures learners always stay up-to-date and resourceful in one simple platform.

âœ¨ AI Chatbot Assistant

An AI-powered chatbot guides learners through:

ðŸ”¹Career Roadmaps â€“ Step-by-step paths for different fields.

ðŸ”¹Doubt Clearing â€“ Quick answers to learning-related questions.

ðŸ”¹Resource Suggestions â€“ Recommends the best courses, books, and tools.

This makes learning personalized and interactive.

âœ¨ Motivation & Progress Tracking

Learning consistency is toughâ€”so the app helps by:

ðŸ”¹Sending daily motivational quotes & reminders.

ðŸ”¹A goal timer to manage study time.

ðŸ”¹A progress tracker that evaluates daily efforts and shows improvement over time.

This ensures learners stay motivated and disciplined.

âœ¨ Community Space

Like Reddit, but focused on self-improvement and learning. Users can:

ðŸ”¹Share knowledge & tips.

ðŸ”¹Ask questions & get peer support.

ðŸ”¹Celebrate milestones & achievements.

The community creates a positive, growth-driven environment
